## Dataset

The document explores data for an online food delivery application, exploring about 1m orders for company's own delivery or pickup service offered in two weeks in march 2021 in 14 different cities of Malaysia. the data shows different attributes of the orders such as order id, payment type of the order, city and zone where the order was made and delivery type of the orders. The is information on the daily orders of the vendor as well as the amount of order for a specific order. whether the order was customers first order, whether the order was failed or successful as well as whether a voucher was used to complete the purchase were all gathered.

The data has a private source  and is confidential.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration I found out that the most favorite vendor among customer is restaurants as opposed to dark stores and the rest, later I categorie the rest of the sotres all asshops. 
I analysed customer behavior in three categories.
Further down I decided to focus on analysisng effect of hour in a day, expected delivery time and total amount of orders on status of orderes (failed/successful).
I found out that dirung lunch time arount (12-3pm) ordered peak in numbers followed by second peak during dinner time. expected delivery time is aount 25 minutes, fast deliveries (less than 10 minutes) are less during dinner time.
the most number of successful orders are in lunch time which is a good sign however most failed  orders are in dinner time.
the average delivery time during each segment increases as we move on further during a day, the alarming part is dinner, since it is account for the highest demands in orders but both high delivery time and fail rate indicate that, fail rates could be due to high expected time.
total money generated is still hig during dinner although the fail rates are also high. There is a potential to generate more money if delivery time can be decreased. I also was found out that pickup preference does not affect success of orders during dinner as people do not show any preference over company's delivery over their own pickup.




## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I only focused on order hour, total money generated, expected delivery time, pickup/delivery preference and left out the rest of the variables that could be effective. I also only focused on the restaurants vendor group.
Also in depicting distribution of total money generated I only put log transformation on on the presentation slides.
